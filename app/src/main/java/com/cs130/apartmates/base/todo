List of stuff to do in apartmates.base

- Singleton Task ID generator or something (we want unique id to support backend)
- Bounty Task Manager / Rotation Task Manager
  - rotate function
    - when called, simply have the next person in the assignee list be assigned to task
    - look for current assignee in list and assign next one
  - have a function that is called when someone completes penalty task
    - if original assignee, do nothing more
    - if someone else, award that person points
    - reset state to pending with new assignee

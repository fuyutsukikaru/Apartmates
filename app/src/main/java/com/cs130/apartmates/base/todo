List of stuff to do in apartmates.base

- Task class
  - still needs description field, get/set functions
- Member class
  - long id
  - int points
  - account info (don't worry too much about this for now)
- Apartment class
  - list of members
  - contains a RotationTaskManager
  - points system resolution
    - a function that decides who owes how much to whom
    - low priority for now, as it's something we probably don't need to demo this coming week
- rotate function
  - when called, simply have the next person in the assignee list be assigned to task
    - look for current assignee in list and assign next one
- penalty actions
  - have a function that checks all tasks for penalty
    - if in active state but duration exceeds time limit, set to penalty
    - probably want to use Timer or something to regularly deduct points as long as in penalty state
  - have a function that is called when someone completes penalty task
    - if original assignee, do nothing more
    - if someone else, award that person points
    - reset state to pending with new assignee


Other things to brainstorm / think about
- there's some duplicate code among different kinds of TaskStates and the interface seems kind of small
  - is there a cleaner way to do it?
  - same question with Tasks
